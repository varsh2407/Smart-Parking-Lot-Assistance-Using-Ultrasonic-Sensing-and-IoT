# 🚗 Smart Parking Lot Assistance  

[![Made with IoT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-IoT-blue)](#)  
[![Powered by ThingSpeak](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-ThingSpeak-brightgreen)](https://thingspeak.com/)  


An **IoT-based smart parking management system** that uses **ultrasonic sensors** to detect empty and occupied parking slots in real time.  
Data is updated every **3 seconds** and sent to the **ThingSpeak Cloud API**, where it is processed and displayed on a **web interface**:  

- 🟢 **Green** → Slot Available  
- 🔴 **Red** → Slot Occupied  

This project helps reduce search time, improves parking efficiency, and is scalable for smart city applications.
